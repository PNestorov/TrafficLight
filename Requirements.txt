Create a traffic light system:

Create an app that has 2 screens.

• On the first screen there is one textview which asks your car model and a button "Start Driving" which leads to the second screen.
• Add a validation check on the car model for a minimum length of 3.
• Pass the car model name to the second screen
• On the second screen the car model is displayed at the top and below there are 3 circles aligned vertically: RED, ORANGE and GREEN.
• The color intensity of the circles should change to which light is active. They should act like a real traffic light:

o RED – 4 seconds bright
o GREEN – 4 seconds bright
o ORANGE – 1 second bright
o The lights should quickly fade when turned on or off
o This is a classic traffic light: Green → Orange → Red and back to Green in a loop

 
• Make sure to test your code with unit tests
